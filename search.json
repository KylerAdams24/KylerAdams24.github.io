    "text": "Woo Pig Sooie. That is a sound commonly heard coming from every corner of Baum-Walker Stadium as the Arkansas Razorbacks play baseball every spring in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Though, the ballpark on 1255 South Razorback Road isn’t the only place you can hear thousands of fans chant those three words in perfect unison. The Hogs, as they’re also known by, tend to frequently migrate their way from the south up to the middle of America to spread their fandom in a city known as Omaha, Nebraska.\nWhile the venue has changed over the years, if the Razorbacks are in town, it will be hard to not know that they have made their way back to compete in the Men’s College World Series. The team even adorns a new nickname when setting up shop in Charles Schwab Field, the “Omahogs.” While Arkansas is arguably an infamous name in the concourses of Charles Schwab, due to the blunder of the century in right field, their repeated appearances afterwards help mend the wound of a day that no one wants to remember back in 2018. 2025 was no different either, as the “Omahogs” and their fans came in droves to support the Razorbacks as they checked another ticket to return try and finally be able to stand on the podium as National Champions. However, a conference rival was looking to repeat the success they attained not two years prior.\nFrom the onset of the 2024-2025 college baseball season, the Arkansas Razorbacks and LSU Tigers were shaping up to be top contenders and favorites to be part of the final eight that get to step foot in the Mecca of college baseball, Charles Schwab Field. Both teams were fighting tooth, tusk and nail to try and covet seven days at the top of the rankings during the regular season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.1     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nD1WeeklyRankings &lt;- read.csv(\"data/D1Baseball 2025 Rankings.csv\")\nNationalSeeds &lt;- read.csv(\"data/National Seeds.csv\")\nCWSOPSERA &lt;- read.csv(\"data/CWS_OPS_ERA.csv\")\nLSUOPSERA &lt;- read.csv(\"data/CWS_OPS_ERA.csv\") |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"LSU\")\nARKOPSERA &lt;- read.csv(\"data/CWS_OPS_ERA.csv\") |&gt;\n  filter(Team==\"Arkansas\")\nCWSPCBD &lt;- read.csv(\"data/CWSPCBD.csv\")\nLSUPCBD &lt;- read.csv(\"data/CWSPCBD.csv\") |&gt;\n  filter(Team ==\"LSU\")\nARKPCBD &lt;- read.csv(\"data/CWSPCBD.csv\") |&gt;\n  filter(Team==\"Arkansas\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bump(data=D1WeeklyRankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, group=Team, color=Team)) +\n  geom_point(data=D1WeeklyRankings, aes (x=Week, y=Rank, group=Team, color=Team), size = 4) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0:14), limits =c(-1.75,15.75)) +\n  geom_text(data = D1WeeklyRankings |&gt; filter(Week == min(Week)), aes(x = Week - .4, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = D1WeeklyRankings |&gt; filter(Week == max(Week)), aes(x = Week + .4, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(0:10))+\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"lightgrey\", \"#9D2235\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\",\"lightgrey\",\"lightgrey\",\"lightgrey\", \"#461D7C\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\",\"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\",\"lightgrey\",\"lightgrey\",\"lightgrey\",\"lightgrey\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Week\",\n    y = \"Ranking\",\n    title = \"Arkansas remains competitive in top 10 rankings.\",\n    subtitle = \"While LSU was able to top the rankings, the Razorbacks never lagged far behind.\",\n    caption = \"Source: D1Baseball | By: Kyler Adams\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.minor.y=element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y=element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\nWarning in compute_group(...): 'StatBump' needs at least two observations per\ngroup\n\n\nWarning in compute_group(...): 'StatBump' needs at least two observations per\ngroup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nWarning in compute_group(...): 'StatBump' needs at least two observations per\ngroup\nWarning in compute_group(...): 'StatBump' needs at least two observations per\ngroup\n\n\nDuring the regular season, the Tigers found themselves tied with the TExas Longhorns for the most weeks in the top spot of D1Baseball’s weekly rankings, though the Razorbacks weren’t one to not give lie down and yield in the fight to showcase their prowess on the diamond.

The fight for the tile of Sole Survivor within the SEC and, potentially, National Champion got underway post haste underneath the lights at Charles Schwab Field in the middle of June with both teams facing off against each other their first round. It was arguably a toss-up between who would be the victor as among the field of eight, the Tigers and Razorbacks found themselves to be nearly, if not the most, neutralizing each other out in terms of what each team found themselves to be more adept at pitching and hitting.\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=CWSOPSERA, aes(x=OPS, y=ERA), color = \"grey\", size=6) +\n  geom_point(data=LSUOPSERA, aes(x=OPS, y=ERA), color = \"#461D7C\", size=6) +\n  geom_point(data=ARKOPSERA, aes(x=OPS, y=ERA), color = \"#9D2235\", size=6) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept =0.897, linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=4.3725, linetype=\"dashed\")+\n    geom_text(\n    aes(x = .87, y = 5.31, label = \"Weaker Pitching, Weaker Hitting\"),\n    color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = .87, y = 3.465, label = \"Stronger Pitching, Weaker Hitting\"),\n    color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n      geom_text(\n    aes(x = .94, y = 5.31, label = \"Weaker Pitching, Stronger Hitting\"),\n    color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(x = .94, y = 3.465, label = \"Stronger Pitching, Stronger Hitting\"),\n    color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(data=LSUOPSERA, aes(x=OPS, y=ERA, label=Team), vjust=-1.2) +\n  geom_text(data=ARKOPSERA, aes(x=OPS, y=ERA, label=Team), hjust=0.6, vjust=-1.2)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n            plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  ) +\n   labs(\n    x = \"OPS (Hitting Performance)\",\n    y = \"ERA (Pitching Performance)\",\n    title = \"Razorbacks and Tigers dominate College World Series metrics.\",\n    subtitle = \"Among the eight CWS teams, LSU and ARK were the strongest competitors.\",\n    caption = \"Source: BaseballReference | By: Kyler Adams\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Razorbacks found themselves on the back foot almost immediately as the Tigers had temporarily felled the Hogs, leading them to tend to their wounds as both teams had a rest day, although the former found themselves on the verge of elimination. With the victory over the Murray State Racers, Arkansas garnered another breath of fresh air before having to face a battered team, either the UCLA Bruins or LSU, as a thunderstorm had delayed the completion of the game the day prior, effectively throwing the losing team to the Hogs with little time to rest. Arkansas was able to raze what was remaining of the Bruins’ pitching staff, the Tigers once again stood as an ironclad knight, waiting to finally quell the now-battered wimper of “Woo Pig Sooie” that had once reverberated throughout the city of Omaha on a fateful Wednesday night.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_step(data=CWSPCBD, aes(x=Day, y=PC, group=Team), color=\"lightgrey\", lty=2) +\n  geom_step(data=LSUPCBD, aes(x=Day, y=PC, group=Team), color=\"#461D7C\", lwd=2) +\n  geom_step(data=ARKPCBD, aes(x=Day, y=PC, group=Team), color=\"#9D2235\", lwd=2) +\n  geom_point(data=LSUPCBD, aes(x=Day, y=PC), color=\"#461D7C\", size=3)+\n  geom_point(data=ARKPCBD, aes(x=Day, y=PC), color=\"#9D2235\", size=3)+\n    annotate(\"text\", x=5.7, y=550, label=\"Arkansas\", color=\"#9D2235\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=5.7, y=235, label=\"LSU\", color=\"#461D7C\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n            plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  ) +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Day\",\n    y = \"Pitch Count\",\n    title = \"LSU limited their pitch count through the semi-finals.\",\n    subtitle = \"The Razorbacks lagged behind LSU by nearly 200 pitches.\",\n    caption = \"Source: ESPN | By: Kyler Adams\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a crucial misplay reminiscent of an error committed years prior, once again the Arkansas Razorbacks found themselves obtaining defeat in the jaws of victory as the LSU Tigers were able to claim the title of Sole Survivor within the SEC and further their National Championship amount with a 2-0 series victory over the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers. The seeding within the College World Series and outcome of the first game brings the thought of questioning an alternative reality where the Razorbacks might have been able to bring out a win in the opening round and how these two closely matched teams might have fared if roles were reversed."

    "text": "Pokémon has, and always, will be a game that will be primarily directed towards children, however even with the target audience being younger, that hasn’t stopped fans from taking the combat of the games to another level. This extends to even the publishers of the series, that being Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as tournaments have been hosted since the release of the first two games in the series back in 1996 in Japan and 1998 globally. Starting with what’s known as the Fifth Generation of Pokémon games (Black/White), The Pokémon Company International started to host an official tournament circuit known as the Video Game Championships (VGC) which has exploded in popularity to player amounts never seen before once they were run in-person again after COVID.\nWhile there is a lot of nuance that can’t be succiently covered regarding the teambuilding process for tournaments, a very basic breakdown of the most recent game’s (Scarlet/Violet) tournament stucture is as follows. VGC is a “Bring 6, Pick 4” style game format where players build out a team of 6 Pokémon but can only bring four to any specific game, with any permutation they desire. Battles are done in the Double Battle format where both players have two Pokémon on the field at all times and the victor is decided once one side as knocked out all four of their opponent’s Pokémon. Each match is a Best-of-3 and the entire tournament is done in a Swiss format until Top Cut (Top 16) in which it transitions into Single Elimination. Events are split up into up to four types, Special Events, Regionals, Internationals and Worlds: Special Events and Regionals are the lowest level, most frequent, event that normally sees a few hundred to just over a thousand players compete to earn Championship Points to become elgible to participate at the championship event, Worlds, at the end of the season. A first place win at either of these events will guaratee a spot to particpate in Worlds alongside an award of Championship Points and prize money. There are normally three International tournaments that are held every season that normally showcase a higher skill floor and ceiling for players as the awards given for placing and winning are dramatically higher compared to Regionals, also to offset the lower comparative frequenticy, but traditionally one would see a large amount of players from across the world compete at these events to garner a larger amount of Championship Points and maybe secure a bye or Day 1 Skip at Worlds. Lastly is Worlds itself, where players have to meet a minimum threshold (or auto-qualify due to winning a prior tournament) to even be elgible to play, typically you won’t see more than 400 players as only the top in the world to compete to determine who is the best trainer for that season.\nWith a basic understanding of the structure of the official circuit, the gameplay portion of this story can now be explained. Pokémon themselves have a plethora of options to manipulate that is well beyond the scope of this article, but one of the most important selections can be highlighted. Every Pokémon has someting called an Ability that can be offensively or defensively oriented in a simplified interpretation, for example, some Abilities may boost the damage output of a move while others may hinder the opponent in a variety of ways. For this analysis, Intimidate is the single Ability that will be examined. Every attack a Pokémon can use is either categorized as a Physical or Special attack and is afforded a damage value that is calculated with a Pokémon Attack and Special Attack value when used. This calculation can be manipulated postively and negatively by a variety of means but one of the most dominant ways to hinder your physically attacking opponents is with Intimidate. When a Pokémon with Intimidate enters the playing field, both opponent’s Pokémon have their Attack stat reduced by 33% and this can be repeated up to five more times, leaving the opponent with a maximum reduction of 75% of their base Attack stat. With this being an immediate and opppressive ability, it’s very common to encounter a Pokémon with this Ability. Within the Top Cut of players in these tournaments, a majority of these players carry at least one Intimidate Pokémon.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nTeamIntimidateUsage &lt;- c(\"Intimidate Pokemon\"=302,\"No Intimidate Pokemon\"=212)\nMonthlyIntimidateUsersVGC24 &lt;- read.csv(\"data/IntimidateMonsByMonth2024VGC.csv\")\nMonthlyLandorusUsage &lt;- MonthlyIntimidateUsersVGC24 |&gt;\n  filter(Pokemon.Used==\"Landorus (Therian)\")\nMonthlyArcanineUsage&lt;- MonthlyIntimidateUsersVGC24 |&gt;\n  filter(Pokemon.Used==\"Arcanine (Hisuian)\")\nMonthlyIncineroarUsage &lt;- MonthlyIntimidateUsersVGC24 |&gt;\n  filter(Pokemon.Used==\"Incineroar\")\nTopIntimidateWinners &lt;- read.csv(\"data/IntimidateMonsWins2024VGC.csv\")\n\nwaffle(TeamIntimidateUsage/2,\n       rows=10,\n       colors=c(\"#439937\",\"#d30000\")\n)+\n  labs(\n    x=\"1 square = 2 teams\",\n    title=\"Intimidate Reings Supreme in Top Cut.\",\n    subtitle=\"The ability found itself on almost 60% of Top 16 teams.\",\n    caption = \"Source: RK9 | By: Kyler Adams\")+\n  theme(\n            plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Intimidate is omnipresent across the entire year of tournaments, the use of specific Pokémon with Intimidate shifts as players try to find new ways to use these Pokémon between tournaments and The Pokemon Company themselves help regularily shift what Pokémon become more popular via something called Regulations. Regulations are a way to prevent the competitive game from becoming too stagnant in strategy development as any specific Regulation Set will see a different mix of Pokémon become permissible to use. This is seen below as until the fifth month of the competitve year, Incineroar was not permitted allowing Landorus and Arcanine to take majority as Intimidate users, then mostly falling off to the wayside after the former’s introduction to Regulation.\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\n  geom_step(data=MonthlyIntimidateUsersVGC24, aes(x=Season.Month, y=Total, group=Pokemon.Used), color=\"lightgrey\", lty=2) +\n  geom_step(data=MonthlyLandorusUsage, aes(x=Season.Month, y=Total, group=Pokemon.Used), color=\"#9b6b53\", lwd=2) +\n  geom_step(data=MonthlyArcanineUsage, aes(x=Season.Month, y=Total, group=Pokemon.Used), color=\"#48474d\", lwd=2) +\n  geom_step(data=MonthlyIncineroarUsage, aes(x=Season.Month, y=Total, group=Pokemon.Used), color=\"#e05149\", lwd=2) +\n  geom_point(data=MonthlyLandorusUsage, aes(x=Season.Month, y=Total, group=Pokemon.Used), color=\"#9b6b53\", size=3)+\n  geom_point(data=MonthlyArcanineUsage, aes(x=Season.Month, y=Total, group=Pokemon.Used), color=\"#48474d\", size=3)+\n  geom_point(data=MonthlyIncineroarUsage, aes(x=Season.Month, y=Total, group=Pokemon.Used), color=\"#e05149\", size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=10.2, y=85, label=\"Landorus (Therian)\", color=\"#9b6b53\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=10.2, y=55, label=\"Arcanine (Hisuian)\", color=\"#48474d\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=10.7, y=138, label=\"Incineroar\", color=\"#e05149\")+\n    theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n            plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  ) +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Times Used\",\n    title = \"Landorus Shirks Usage Lead Near Season's End.\",\n    subtitle = \"With the advent of Restricted Pokémon being allowed, Incineroar found its footing within the metagame.\",\n    caption = \"Source: RK9 | By: Kyler Adams\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nEven with Landorus and Arcanine having a five month head start on Incineraor, it found itself to be the dominating Intimidate Pokémon as trainers found it to be the most effecient Pokémon to lower opponent’s Attack as Regulations shifted throughout the latter half of the compettive season, though no Intimidate Pokémon was able to find itself as a World Champion in the 2024 VGC Season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=TopIntimidateWinners, aes(x=reorder(Pokemon.Used,Number.Won), weight=Number.Won, fill=Event))+\n  coord_flip()+\n      theme_classic()+\n  theme(\n            plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8)\n  ) +\n   labs(\n    x = \"Pokémon\",\n    y = \"Times Won\",\n    title = \"Incineroar Supplants Itself as Top Contender.\",\n    subtitle = \"While lacking a Worlds win 2024, the Heel Pokémon dominated the lesser tournaments.\",\n    caption = \"Source: RK9 | By: Kyler Adams\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the 2024 VGC Season has came to a close, all of these Pokémon are still seeing use as the 2025 Season is well underway, especially Incineroar, as it has came in first place in the Stuttgart, Germany Regional and the Latin American International Championship. Once tournaments pick back up after the holiday break in mid-Janurary, another shake-up may be at hand as a new Regulation Set will be implemented and the upcoming release of Pokémon Champions, a VGC-focused battle simulator may further shift the usability of Intimidate Pokémon as mechanics from prior games are re-implemented, leading to a new realm of permutations and use cases."
